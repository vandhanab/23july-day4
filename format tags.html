 <p><b>A flower is the bloom or blossom of a plant.</b> </p>
 <p><strong>The flower is the part of a plant that produces seeds, which in time become other flowers.</strong></p>
 <p><i>This is thanks to a process called pollination that is carried out either by insects or the wind.</i></p>
 <p><em>Every type of flower is different, in color, smell, shape and size.</em></p>
 <p><small>Happiness held is the seed; Happiness shared is the flower.</small></p>
 <p><sub>Love is the flower you've got to let grow.</sub></p>
 <p><sup>If you look the right way, you can see that the whole world is a garden.</sup></p>
 <p><del>A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and a man cannot live without love.</del></p> 
 <p><u>Happiness held is the seed; Happiness shared is the flower.</u></p>
